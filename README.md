# Applying-RF-Model-to-Single-cell-seq-RNA

We will follow the following steps to create a Random Forest model for cell type prediction:
1. Data preprocessing: We will perform data cleaning and normalization on the training data to remove missing values. We will use packages such as scanpy and pandas to preprocess the data.Preprocessing will include quality control and normalization.
2. Feature selection: We will select the most informative genes using feature selection techniques such as PCA. This step will help reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of the model.
3. Model training: We will train a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data with the selected features. According to some sources, Random forest showes superior performance in classification of genes [2]:
We will tune the hyperparameters of the model using cross-validation to achieve the best accuracy on the validation set.
4. Model evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of the model on the test set by calculating the accuracy score.
